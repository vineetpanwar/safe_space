# SAFE Space - A Mental Health Wellness Chatbot

### 1. INTRODUCTION :
In recent years, the spotlight on mental health has intensified, underscoring its critical
importance to public health. Despite growing awareness, significant barriers such as societal
stigma, access issues, and a scarcity of resources continue to obstruct effective mental health
care. In this landscape, technology, particularly through the use of chatbots, emerges as a
promising solution to bridge these gaps. By developing a chatbot designed to assess mental
health, we can offer a more accessible, immediate, and less daunting entry point for individuals
seeking mental health care.
This chatbot, through conversational engagement, would be capable of asking users a series of
targeted questions to evaluate their mental health status. This process not only helps in providing
a preliminary mental health score but also in making the experience more approachable for users.
Importantly, the chatbot can guide users towards appropriate resources by connecting them with
healthcare professionals, based on the assessment outcomes and their location.
The introduction of such a chatbot represents a significant step forward in making mental health
care more accessible and less intimidating to the general population. By sidestepping the
traditional barriers to mental health services, it offers a novel, user-friendly approach to
understanding and seeking help for mental health issues. This initiative has the potential to make
a profound impact on public health by ensuring mental health wellness and resources are more
readily available to those in need, contributing to a more inclusive and supportive healthcare
environment.

### 2. OVERVIEW AND SCOPE
This project aims to create a chatbot leveraging Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and Python to
facilitate mental health assessments. Through engaging conversations, the chatbot will ask users
a sequence of questions designed to evaluate their mental health. These questions are crafted to
be both structured for consistency and flexible to adapt to individual users' needs. Based on the
users' responses, the chatbot calculates a mental health score. Utilizing this score alongside the
users' geographical information, it then suggests nearby mental health professionals or resources.
A core focus of the project is to maintain the highest standards of user privacy, data security, and
information accuracy. This ensures that users can trust the chatbot not only to provide them with
reliable mental health evaluations and recommendations but also to safeguard their personal
information. Ultimately, this chatbot aims to deliver a secure, accurate, and user-friendly
experience for individuals seeking mental health support.
